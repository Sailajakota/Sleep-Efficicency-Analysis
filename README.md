# 💤 Sleep Efficiency Analysis using Tableau

This project explores how various demographic and lifestyle factors affect sleep efficiency. Using a real-world dataset and Tableau for visualization, we uncover patterns across age, gender, chronotypes (wake-up time patterns), and behaviors like alcohol consumption, smoking, caffeine intake, and exercise.

## 📊 Project Overview

Sleep efficiency is a critical indicator of sleep quality. In this project, **Tableau** was used to build a multi-faceted dashboard that reveals how different variables interact with sleep outcomes. The data was preprocessed, binned where necessary, and analyzed through various visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, and clustered views.

## 📌 Key Dashboards & Analyses

- **Sleep Duration vs Sleep Efficiency**  
  Identifies optimal sleep durations and how efficiency changes with under/oversleeping.

- **Chronotype Clustering**  
  Clusters individuals by wake-up time and analyzes how alignment affects sleep efficiency.

- **Lifestyle Factors**  
  Evaluates the impact of alcohol, smoking, exercise, and caffeine on sleep quality by gender.

- **Demographic Trends**  
  Analyzes sleep efficiency by age and gender groups to reveal broader trends.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Females waking up very early (5–6 AM) tend to have **lower sleep efficiency**, suggesting misaligned chronotypes.
- Highest sleep efficiency is seen among those sleeping **6–8 hours per night**.
- **Smoking and alcohol** generally reduce sleep quality, while **exercise** is positively associated with higher efficiency.
- Age has a mild negative correlation with sleep efficiency, but lifestyle behaviors can offset some of this decline.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Health professionals** seeking data-driven sleep recommendations  
- **Wellness app developers** looking for behavioral triggers to track  
- **Sleep researchers** interested in chronotype and lifestyle effects  
- **General users** aiming to improve their sleep hygiene

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Personalize sleep schedules based on **chronotype**, especially for early-rising females.
- Maintain a consistent sleep duration between **6 to 8 hours**.
- Reduce alcohol and smoking while promoting regular exercise for better sleep.
- Use demographic profiling to guide sleep coaching and digital wellness tools.
